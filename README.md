# Stockly Entry Test

# How to do the test

 - All the exercises are in the directory `exercises`.
 - Each file is an exercice.
 - Each file should export a function.
 - Exercices are sorted alphabetically by order of difficulty. a is the easiest.
 - Only the files in the directory `exercises` will be read.
 - You have 45 minutes to do the tests and push your commits (before 10:42:35).
 - We strongly advise you to code only where it's written `# Write your code here`.

# How you are evaluated

 - You will be judged on the state of `origin/master` at 10:42:35.
 - You have all the tests in the directory `tests`.
 - All your functions must pass all the tests (using the `pytest` command).
 - The test framework is [pytest](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/).

# Helpers

 - Run `python3 -m venv env && source ./env/bin/activate` to create a python virtual environment and activate it.
 - Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to be able to run tests.
 - Run `pytest` to check your answers.
 - Run `pytest tests/${name_of_test_file}` to check only one answer.
 - If your answers are correct, tests will run quickly. Tests running slowly means that some of your answers are not correct.

# Further notice

 - We will use the last commit on the repository at 10:42:35. Don't forget to push your code!
 - The exercises take around 33 minutes to complete. The 12 other are for git manipulations.
 - Please do not change the file names, if you do and it doesn't work then too bad for you.
 - No human will read your code, code as you like we just want it to work.
 - You can try to hack the test but if you fail or are caught, you'll have a grade of 0.
 - Any modifications to any files not in `exercises` will be considered as cheating.
 - It is strictly forbidden to overwrite the initial commit, this will be considered as cheating.

Good luck!
