# Exercice: Camel To Kebab

## Explanation:
You must code a function that transforms a string from camelCase (see Further Notice) to
kebab-case (see Further Notice). This function must not break abreviations.

## Example:
```
camel_to_kebab('CamelCaseString') == 'camel-case-string'
camel_to_kebab('CamelCaseStringWithABREV') == 'camel-case-string-with-abrev'
camel_to_kebab('CamelCaseStringWithABREVInCenter') == 'camel-case-string-with-abrev-in-center'
```

## Expected Time
You should spend around 15 minutes on this exercice

## Further Notice
- You have more examples in <root>/tests/test_d_camel_to_kebab.py
- See [camelCase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case)
- See [kebabCase](http://wiki.c2.com/?KebabCase)
